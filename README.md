# Personal Website

This is the source for my portfolio website where you can find information about me, my past and future projects, and my industry experiences. 

## Tech Stack

- NextJS  
The website is built using NextJS static-site generation. Next is built on top of ReactJS. Overkill? Sure, but it's still makes for a great developer experience.
- TypeScript  
This is mostly overkill, but it's a great superset of JavaScript and reminds me of languages like C++ and Java. 
- TailwindCSS.  
An incredible (but opinionated) CSS framework that allows inline styling in HTML. Ever since I started using Tailwind I can't go back to native CSS
- AOS  
A CSS library that provides very clean and attractive animations during page scrolls.
- Vercel  
The creators of NextJS, Vercel is incredibly easy to use, and provides all the functionality I need, including DNS setup and SSL through Let's Encrypt.
